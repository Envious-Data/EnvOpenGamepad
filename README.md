# EnvOpenGamepad
 An open source gamepad using a RP2040 designed to be like popular gamepads but with a few bonus features and ease of repairability.



## Planned features
- layout similar to popular models
- additional buttons over popular models
- turbo mode
- hall effect sticks and triggers


## Features I want but cant implement (yet?)
- vibration/rumble
- wireless
- touchpad?

## Why

no real reason, I had this idea bouncing around in my head for ages so to procrastinate on other projects ill work on this one till I procrastinate on this one by working on others but really I just enjoy designing and making things and if they serve as a good example to do something whilst also helping me learn then its doing one of its main jobs.

I generally like things that can be repaired so if I can make something that surpasses a commercially avaliable example while being reasonable in cost then thats great because I really dont like not being able to repair things which is sometimes the case for commercially avaliable solutions.
